# Employee-Attrition-Data-Analysis
🧑‍💼 Employee Attrition Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing employee data to identify the key drivers of attrition and provide actionable insights for Human Resource (HR) teams to reduce employee turnover. Attrition, or employee churn, is one of the most critical challenges organizations face, as it directly impacts recruitment costs, training investments, and overall productivity.

The dataset used contains details such as age, department, salary, years at company, performance scores, and attrition status. The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, ensuring the dataset is free of duplicates and missing values. Following this, a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to explore patterns and distributions across variables.

The analysis included calculation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as:

Overall attrition rate (39%)

Attrition by department, age group, salary band, and tenure

Correlation of numerical features like age, salary, and years at company

Through visualization techniques such as bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps, the analysis clearly highlighted risk areas. Sales (54%) and Engineering (43%) departments showed the highest attrition, while Marketing (20%) had the lowest. Attrition was more pronounced among older employees (51–60 years, 75%) and employees with very short (≤2 years) or very long (20+ years) tenure. Interestingly, higher-salaried employees (>90k) also showed elevated attrition (55%), suggesting dissatisfaction beyond compensation.

The project concludes with business recommendations: improve onboarding and mentoring for new hires, provide growth pathways for long-tenure employees, and design retention strategies tailored to high-risk departments.
